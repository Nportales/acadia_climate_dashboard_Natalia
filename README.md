# acadia_climate_dashboard_Natalia
This GitHub repository stores the Acadia Climate Dashboard Project and the associated scripts used to compile, clean, and visualize climate data from Acadia National Park. The [R Shiny Dashboard](https://github.com/Kylelima21/acadia_climate_dashboard/blob/main/app.R) summarizes climate data gathered from local weather stations, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Oceanography Centre (NOC). A [GitHub page](https://kylelima21.github.io/acadia_climate_dashboard/) has been created to provide access to climate data sources and facilitate data downloads. It includes direct links to scripts (in this repository) for compiling and cleaning data, along with detailed instructions for downloading data and using the scripts associated with each data source.
